# MeDuSA: mixed model-based deconvolution of cell-state abundances along a one-dimensional trajectory

## Overview

**MeDuSA** is a fine-resolution cellular deconvolution method that leverages scRNA-seq data as a reference to estimate `cell-state abundance along a one-dimensional trajectory` in bulk RNA-seq data. **MeDuSA** features the use of a linear mixed model (LMM) to fit a cell state in question (either a single cell or the mean of multiple cells) as a fixed effect and the remaining cells of the same cell type individually as random effects accounting for correlations between cells. This model improves the deconvolution accuracy because the random-effect component allows each cell has a specific weight on bulk gene expression, resulting in a better capturing of variance in bulk gene expression. This model also ameliorates the collinearity problem between cells at the focal state (fitted as a fixed effect) and those at adjacent states (fitted as random effects) because of the shrinkage of random effects.


# New version
MeDuSA now also supports cell-state deconvolution for annotated `cell states (cell types)`. Please check the link below: 
https://github.com/LeonSong1995/MeDuSAJ. 
MeDuSAJ is more robust for estimating cell state (cell type) abundance for rare cells, albeit with a slightly increased computational burden. Tutorials can be found in the [README](https://github.com/LeonSong1995/MeDuSAJ) of MeDuSAJ.
